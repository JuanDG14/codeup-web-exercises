    <h1>Important FAQ's about Yellowstone National Parks</h1>

    <dl>
        <dt>Where do I Make Reservations to Stay in Yellowstone?
        </dt>
        <dd>Yellowstone National Park Lodges operates the nine lodges in the park. All are open from late spring through
            fall, but only two are open in the winter: Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel. Be sure to
            make a reservation early!
        </dd>

        <dt>How did Yellowstone get its name?
        </dt>
        <dd>Yellowstone National Park is named after the Yellowstone River, the major river running through the park.
            According to French-Canadian trappers in the 1800s, they asked the name of the river from the Minnetaree
            tribe,
            who live in what is now eastern Montana. They responded “Mi tse a-da-zi,” which literally translates as
            “Rock
            Yellow River.” The trappers translated this into French as “Roche Jaune” or “Pierre Jaune.” In 1797,
            explorer-geographer David Thompson used the English translation—“Yellow Stone.” Lewis and Clark called the
            Yellowstone River by the French and English forms. Subsequent use formalized the name as “Yellowstone.
        </dd>

        <dt>Is Yellowstone the largest national park?
        </dt>
        <dd>No. More than half of Alaska’s national park units are larger, including Wrangell–St. Elias National Park
            and
            Preserve, which is the largest unit (13 million acres) in the National Park System. Until 1994, Yellowstone
            (at
            2.2 million acres) was the largest national park in the contiguous United States. That year Death Valley
            National Monument was expanded and became a national park—it has more than 3 million acres.
        </dd>

        <dt>Is Yellowstone the most visited national park?
        </dt>
        <dd>Yellowstone is in the top five national parks for number of recreational visitors. Great Smoky Mountains
            National Park often has the most. Visit https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/ to view up-to-date statistics for all
            national parks.
        </dd>

        <dt>What is the difference between a national park and a national forest?
        </dt>
        <dd>National parks are administered by the Department of the Interior and national forests by the Department of
            Agriculture. The National Park Service is mandated to preserve resources unimpaired, while the Forest
            Service is
            mandated to wisely manage resources for many sustainable uses. Six national forests surround Yellowstone
            National Park.
        </dd>

        <dt>How many rangers work in Yellowstone?
        </dt>
        <dd>Approximately 738 people work for the National Park Service during the peak summer season. Approximately 386
            are
            permanent, year-round employees. Park rangers work in education, resource management, law enforcement,
            emergency
            medical services, and backcountry operations. Other employees specialize in research, maintenance,
            management,
            administration, trail maintenance, fire management, and fee collection.
        </dd>

        <dt>How do you become a park ranger?
        </dt>
        <dd>Many National Park Service employees begin their careers as volunteers or as seasonal employees. Hiring is
            very
            competitive and is conducted through the Office of Personnel Management. Learn more about working with us.
        </dd>

        <dt>Can we swim in rivers and lakes?
        </dt>
        <dd>Swimming is not recommended because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold. Firehole Canyon, near
            Madison
            Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer. Soaking in thermal features is illegal. The area known as
            the
            Boiling River, north of Mammoth Hot Springs, allows soaking in the Gardner River near thermal outflow, but
            not
            in the feature itself. Soaking is allowed during daylight hours only and at your
        <dt>What is the highest peak in the park?
        </dt>
        <dd>Eagle Peak in the southeastern part of Yellowstone is the highest at 11,358 feet.
        </dd>

        <dt>What is the Continental Divide?
        </dt>
        <dd>Think of the Continental Divide as the crest of the continent. Theoretically, when precipitation falls on
            the
            west side of the Divide, it eventually reaches the Pacific Ocean. When it falls on the east side of the
            Divide,
            it eventually reaches the Atlantic Ocean. In Yellowstone (as elsewhere), this ridgeline is not straight. You
            cross the Continental Divide three times between the South Entrance and the Old Faithful area. Craig Pass is
            the
            highest crossing, at 8,262 feet.

    <h3>Hot Springs National Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot Springs National Park covers a total area of 5,550 acres.</li>
        <li>The number of people visiting Hot Springs in 2019 was 1,467,153 (All Years).</li>
        <li>Hot Springs was made a national park on March 4, 1921.</li>
        <li>There is no entrance fee for Hot Springs National Park.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gateway Arch National Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Forty blocks of St. Louis were demolished to build the arch and its surrounding park.</li>
        <li>The arch’s two legs were built separately, and if their measurements were off by as little as 1/64th of an
            inch, they would not have been able to join at the top.
        </li>
        <li>The arch is as tall as it is wide.</li>
        <li>The unique tram system was invented by a man with no formal engineering training.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Channel Island National Park</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Channel Islands were created by tectonic forces, which caused them to rise up out of the ocean five
            million years ago. They have always been islands separate from the mainland, which is why they have unique
            plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.
        </li>
        <li> The oldest human remains in North America, dating to 13,000 B.C., were discovered in 1959 on Santa Rosa
            Island.
        </li>
        <li> Diablo Peak (Devil’s Peak), on Santa Cruz Island, is the tallest peak on the Channel Islands at 2,450
            feet.
        </li>
        <li>If not for the Channel Islands, there would be no seabirds in Southern California.</li>
